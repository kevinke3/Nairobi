                <h2><i class="fas fa-city"></i> Introduction</h2>
                <p>Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The name comes from the Maasai phrase <em>Enkare Nairobi</em>, which translates to "cool water", a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. Founded in 1899 as a railway depot, Nairobi has grown to become a cosmopolitan metropolis of over 4 million people.</p>
                <p>Nairobi is known as the "Green City in the Sun" due to its lush tree-lined streets and pleasant climate. It's the only capital city in the world that contains a national park within its boundaries, offering a unique blend of urban development and natural wildlife.</p>

                <p>Nairobi was established in 1899 by the British colonial authorities in British East Africa as a rail depot on the Uganda Railway. The town quickly grew to replace Mombasa as the capital of Kenya in 1907. After independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital of the Republic of Kenya.</p>
                <p>During Kenya's colonial period, the city became a center for the colony's coffee, tea and sisal industry. Nairobi also served as the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate, which attracted many settlers from Britain and South Africa.</p>
                <p>In recent decades, Nairobi has become an important commercial and cultural hub in Africa. It hosts many multinational companies and organizations, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), giving it the nickname "The Safari Capital of the World".</p>
